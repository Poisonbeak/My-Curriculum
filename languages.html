                <p>I am very proficient at Javascript, as it is my favorite programming language.
                    I have followed many courses and I'm able to easily manipulate the DOM and work with any page element as objects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>C++</h3>
                <img src="images/cpp_logo.png" alt="">
                <p>I am capable of making basic C++ programs and functions, as well as manage pointers, matrices and records.
                    I use this language mostly for programming competitions such as OII and CyberChallenge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Python</h3>
                <img src="images/python_logo.png" alt="">
                <p>I have followed courses on Python programming, such as list and string management and basic read/write operations with files.
                    It is an interesting programming language, but one I use rarely.</p>
